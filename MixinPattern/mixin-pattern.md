### Mixin Pattern
> This pattern is use to Enhance the functionality of objects or classes without inheritance.

A mixin is an object that we can use in order to add reusable functinality to another object or class without using the ```inheritance```. We Modify the Object ProtoType wuith ```Object.assign()``` method. This method give us power to add the Mixin Proporties directly to target Object.

> Each *New Instance* of the Object will get the *Mixin* Enhanced properties as they are added to the Target Object Prototype chain
